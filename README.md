# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way
This folder is for the codes of "Learn Python The Hard Way" which coded by myself
## It's structure is just as the same as the book.For example,there will be 52 exercises and a appendix.
## Every exercise will be test by my editer "sublime text 3",and then upload to the github.
P.S. To improve my will, I will code every exercise.
